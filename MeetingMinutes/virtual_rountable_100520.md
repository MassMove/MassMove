# MassMove Virtual Roundtable (10/05/2020)

## Group mission/principles/purpose
- Not affiliated with a political group/cause/agenda.
- Fundamental principle is democracy / working towards the interests of the masses.
- We don’t have the answers; we’re just getting people in the same room (“away from the adults”) to put our heads together and figure out how to improve the world.
- People (no matter what political affiliation, etc.) all generally want the same things: food, jobs, safe healthy happy lives for themselves and their children. Connect with people on this level and have productive discussion about how these things can be worked towards.
- Our goal is to overcome political factionalism/tribalism and unite people to work towards our shared goals.

## Onboarding form/process
- Funnelling new members towards the right channels where they can contribute (right now the process of how to get involved is pretty opaque).
    - Prime example — The Portal subreddit & discord
- u/everbetterproject has an onboarding form ready to go on Airtable
    - Get email addresses, skills, & commitment level.
    - But ideally we will already have a database of current projects & the skills/ppl needed, so that people can immediately be matched with a project after signing up
- Clarify that even people who don’t necessarily want to commit to anything right now should still fill out the form to be added to the email newsletter and to stay in the loop; or alternatively have a separate signup for just the newsletter?

## Group organization & project leadership
- Creating channels of communication & accountability
- Reviving the old “focus of attention” threads, for a place for people to suggest projects, volunteer to head up a project, or get involved in something.

## Email newsletter
- A weekly email newsletter. Short, plaintext, with a quick blurb with updates/news/important links
- Links to vote in current motions, and link to weekly discussion thread on Reddit
- How to set up a mailing list/listserv ??? (find someone who can do this)

## Reddit involvement
- Reviving pinned weekly discussion threads
- Better platform for motions + link to these in newsletter
- Auto-response when people join with how the sub works, how to get involved, pointing them to the wiki

## Mod strategy & low-effort posts
- We should consider a rigorous standard for posts:
    - No cross-posting without context; images/videos/links must include why OP thinks they are productive/relevant to the goals of the group and are worthy of further discussion (re: u/Eleftourasa’s post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MassMove/comments/gdxrz7/re_low_effort_posts/)).
- Moderation strategy should be transparent: list detailed rules on the sidebar/wiki, and if mods remove a post they should give thorough reasons why.
- Lock posts rather than removing if possible.
- The comment section, on the other hand, will be generally unmoderated and open for respectful, productive discussion (& disagreement!).
- An example of the quality of content we need (regarding re-open protests):
    - Unproductive: “These fucking idiots…”
    - Productive: “Here is evidence that …, can we investigate this further?”
    - Productive: Identifying movements that are doing the right things and amplifying their messages
- Rigorously moderating posts while allowing uncensored discussions in the comments should hopefully allow for both a democratic platform of free speech while maintaining the focus of the group with high-quality, productive content.
- Setting this high standard for posts might reduce activity and highly upvoted content, but we will increase activity level and numbers through other means (onboarding, recruiting…)

## Recruiting & outreach
- Once our onboarding channels are set up, build list of related subreddits and reach out to mods to sticky an announcements and get the word out.
    - “Here’s what we’re doing, here’s why it’s relevant to your group’s purpose, here’s how you can get involved…”

## Reddit wiki & site design
- The wiki is currently pretty vague & confusing and also hasn’t been updated in a while.
- Update wiki with clear About/Mission/Goals, as well as How to Get Involved, Active  Projects, Subreddit Rules & Guidelines, Resources
- Possibly accumulate a Resource list of youtube channels, books, news outlets, podcasts which do a good job of giving unbiased accounts of the forces at play in the world.
    - Ex: This post with some youtube channels listed: https://www.reddit.com/r/MassMove/comments/evknjx/boosting_existing_antimisinformation/
    - Ex: AllSides Balanced news showing side-by-side stories from left/center/right.
- Set up the Github-hosted website which is currently still blank (At some point we might want to move our main operation off of Reddit).

## Hosting a fake-news database
- u/sld has created a comprehensive database which links sites, ips, fb/google analytics trackers, etc. as a graph
- Hosting this database so we can get this live?
    - Post on reddit/github to figure this out.
